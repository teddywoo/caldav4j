# Calendaring #

Calendaring is one of the big issues of the next years.
Email connects people, calendars make people meet!

So these days we find tonns of calendar applications and platform: iPhone integrates with Apple Calendar Server, Exchange with windows mobile, Blackberry has its own server... all different platforms.

Caldav aim is to create interoperability between them.

# Caldav #
Caldav is an access protocolo for events, tasks and meeting.
```
CalDAV : calendar = IMAP : email
```

Caldav is built on top of HTTP, so you can see a caldav repository even with your browser

Caldav is trendy: Apple and Google use caldav for their calendar servers!

# CalDAV4j #

Caldav4j is the first java library for caldav.

It supports a great part of RFC and has a flexible and easy way to query for calendar items stored on server.

It's compliance to the standards is tested with junits, and periodically it's verified against some caldav server implementation
