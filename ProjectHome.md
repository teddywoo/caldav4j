## CalDAV4j Overview ##

<table><tr><td>

Caldav4j is MOVING <a href='https://github.com/caldav4j/caldav4j'>TO GITHUB</a>


CalDAV4j is a java library implementing the CalDAV protocol. <br>
<br>
It makes easy to issue complex queries to a caldav server, supporting free-busy and calendar-collections. Moreover supports the standard add/remove of events.<br>
CalDAV4j extends the Android Calendar App with  <a href='BuildAndroid.md'>Caldav Sync implementation for Android</a>.<br>
<br>
While we're moving to <a href='http://jackrabbit.apache.org/jackrabbit-webdav-library.html'>jackrabbit</a>, CalDAV4j is still  based on Slide project's <a href='http://jakarta.apache.org/slide/webdav-client.html'>WebDAV client library</a> (which itself is an extension of the Apache's <a href='http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/'>HttpClient</a> library) to allow high level manipulation of CalDAV calendar collections as well as lower level CalDAV protocol interactions.<br>

CalDAV4j

## Goals ##

  * A high level API: This API works at the level of ical4j objects, and allows for high level operations. All the "hard" protocol work that you need to do to make this happen is hidden from the end user. Supports:
    * an [easy and flexible query language](CreateCaldavQuery.md) (eg. for events in a given date range);
    * recurring event management (eg. updating master events and recurrence instances);

  * A lower level protocol API: Let's you work at the Http/WebDAV/CalDAV protocol level by creating instances of HttpMethods (like GetMethod, MkCalendar, ReportMethod) and executing them.

  * Performance: When possible caches (such as caches of etags and icalendar resources) are maintained so that network chatter and parsing of icalender files is minimized.

  * Compliance: We aim to be implement the following specs
    * [CalDAV spec](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4791) and updates
    * [WebDAV tickets spec](http://www.sharemation.com/~milele/public/dav/draft-ito-dav-ticket-00.txt)
    * [Caldav Scheduling specs](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-desruisseaux-caldav-sched/)
  * Reliability: a lot of functional tests and the "rails" for checking your caldav implementation support.

  * ... ?

More information [here](Status.md).
## Building ##

CalDAV4j uses [Maven 2.x](http://maven.apache.org/) as its build system. [Here](BuildingCalDAV4j.md) is some more information on building CalDAV4j


## Using ##

Download the latest JAR file and make sure it's in your classpath. The unit tests are the best place right now to see how to use CalDAV4j. Tutorials and more documentation are forthcoming.

## What's Next ##

  * jackrabbit support
  * android resource bundle
  * scheduling support

The [roadmap](Roadmap.md) will be updated as things flesh out more.
